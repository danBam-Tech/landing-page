        <h1>Privacy Policy for WAIS</h1>
        <p>Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how WAIS (“the Application”) collects and uses information provided by users. By
            using the Application, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>WAIS does <strong>not</strong> automatically collect personal information such as your real name, email
            address, phone number, or other identifiers.</p>

        <p>However, the Application allows you to input information voluntarily, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A name or identifier</strong> (which may be real, fictional, or an alias)</li>
            <li><strong>Ideas or text content</strong> you choose to enter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All information you provide is under your control and is not verified or linked to your real identity.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>The information you input is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating and maintaining the app’s features</li>
            <li>Displaying, saving, and organizing your ideas</li>
            <li>Improving usability and performance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for advertising, analytics tracking, or user profiling.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any user-provided content—including names or ideas—with third parties.</p>
        <p>Your data is processed only within the Application to support functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your inputs are retained only for as long as required for the Application to function. You may delete your
            inputs at any time from within the Application (if supported) or by contacting us.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Reasonable security measures are implemented to protect your data. However, no electronic storage method is
            completely secure, and absolute protection cannot be guaranteed.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>WAIS is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect identifiable information from
            children.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated
            “Last updated” date.</p>
        <br>
